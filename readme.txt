This plugin adds Delivery Notes for the WooCommerce Shop Plugin. You can add company info as well as personal notes and policies to the print page.

== Description ==

With this plugin you can print out delivery notes for the orders via the WooCommerce Shop Plugin. You can edit the Company/Shop name, Company/Shop postal address and also add personal notes, conditions/policies (like a refund policy) and a footer imprint/branding.

The plugin adds a new side panel on the order page to allow shop administrators to print out delivery notes. This is useful for a lot of shops that sell goods which need delivery notes for shipping or with added refund policies etc. In some countries (e.g. in the European Union) such refund policies are required so this plugin could help to combine this with the order info for the customer.

= Special Features =
* The plugin comes with an attached template for the delivery note (printing) page - you could also copy this to your theme and customize it to your needs! The plugin will recognize the new place. (See under [FAQ here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/faq/))
* All setting fields on the settings pages are optional - you can leave them empty to not use them at all or only apply what you need.
* If the company/shop name field is left empty then the regular website/blog title is used (defined via regular WordPress options)
* If there are added "Customer Notes" (regular WooCommerce feature) for an order these will automatically displayed at the bottom of the delivery note.
* Included contextual help tab system with new WordPress 3.3 standard! (Will also be extended if needed!)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `woocommerce-delivery-notes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Look under the WooCommerce menu for the entry "Delivery Notes Settings" and adjust them to your needs
4. On single order pages you'll find a new meta box on the right side where it says "View & Print Delivery Note" you can open the delivery note for the actual order and print it out directly
5. Go and manage your orders - good luck with sales :)

**Please note:** You must run WordPress 3.3 or higher and WooCommerce 1.4 or higher in order tun this plugin. This is due to changes in WooCommerc v1.4+!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use a Custom Template for the printing page? =
If you want to use your own template then all you need to do is copy the `/wp-content/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/delivery-note-template` folder and paste it inside your `/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/woocommerce` folder (if not there just create it). The folder from the plugin comes with the default template and the basic CSS stylesheet file. You can modifiy this to fit your own needs.

*Note:* This works with both single themes and child themes (if you use some framework like Genesis). If your current active theme is a child theme put the custom folder there! (e.g. `/wp-content/themes/your-child-theme-name/woocommerce`)

= What Template Functions can I use? =
Various functions are available in the template, especially many Delivery Notes specific template functions. Open the `woocommerce-delivery-notes/wcdn-print.php` file to see all available functions.

*Please note:* This is only intended for developers who know what they do! Please be careful with adding any code/functions! The default template and functions should fit most use cases.

= What will actually get printed out? =
No worries, the print buttons at the top and the bottom will automatically be hidden on print!
The other sections get printed as styled via the packaged template (or your custom template if configured). For the shop/company name and all other notes sections: only these will get printed which are actually configured.
Beyond the styling of your template be aware of any special features of your used browser - I highly recommend to use the "Print Preview" feature of your browser which all current versions of Firefox, Chrome and Opera support.

= Can you update the plugin with feature X or option Y?
Mmh. Maybe.
The basic intention is to have the plugin at the same time as leightweight and useful as possible. So any feature request needs to ...

== Screenshots ==

1. Plugin's settings page where you can set up to five fields for the delivery note.
2. Contextual help tabs on the plugin's settings page.
3. Delivery Note printing page with default template - and the five custom sections marked (yellow)
